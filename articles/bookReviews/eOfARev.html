        <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
          <p>I first read Charles Taylor’s <i>The Ethics of Authenticity</i> (hereafter referred to as “EoA”) as part of an International Baccalaureate Philosophy class during my junior year of High School. At the time, it was both difficult and groundbreaking. </p>

          <p>Less than a year ago, a friend and I decided it would be interesting to read the book again- would we still find it difficult? Were the ideas as good as we originally thought them to be? Could we learn something we had missed in the first go-round?</p>

          <p>Before I begin the review, two things must be noted. The first is that I have never read any of Taylor’s other works, nor have I listened to any of his lectures. Given this, it must be understood that I am approaching every one of Taylor’s ideas as if they were in a vacuum of sorts- I am treating “EofA” as a standalone work. The second is that in summarizing Taylor’s ideas, I will skip most of the history he gives behind authenticity as an ideal. This history is important and takes up perhaps 15% of the book. However, my purpose in writing this review is to analyze the ideas themselves- I’m not primarily interested in their origins. What follows is my summary of the book, which itself will be followed by my view of it.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Malaises of Modernity</h2>

          <p>Taylor begins “EofA” with an introduction and short discussion on what he calls three of the “malaises of modernity”, defined as:<p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">"features of our contemporary culture and society that people experience as a loss or a decline, even as civilization 'develops'"</blockquote> 
          <p>People usually point to malaises of modernity as being changes that occurred after 1950. These malaises are, in order, individualism, the overuse of instrumental reason, and soft despotism.</p>

          <p>The majority of the book focuses on individualism and its relation to authenticity. I will do likewise.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Why We Struggle To Have The Necessary Conversations</h2>

          <p>Individualism as Taylor sees it can be summed up as the idea that:<p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">"people have a right…to determine the shape of their lives in a whole host of ways that their ancestors couldn't control.”</blockquote>
          <p>Many think both that individualism is the finest achievement of modern civilization and that it has not yet been taken far enough. Having more control over one’s life is usually seen as a good thing, but 
          <blockquote class="blockquote">“the dark side of individualism is a centering on the self, which both flattens and narrows our lives, makes them poorer in meaning, and less concerned with others and society.”</blockquote> 
          <p>This sort of sentiment is seen in criticisms of the current generation as “narcissistic” or a “me-generation”.</p>

          <p>Taylor thinks that the dismissive method with which both “boosters” and “knockers” discuss authenticity serves only to blind everyone to what the ideal is. Taylor takes a different approach- authenticity as a moral ideal. Authenticity isn’t simply an excuse for people to be self-indulgent (even if it’s often used for that very purpose). However, the ideal often sinks to the level of an axiom: the highest form of living is to be authentic to one’s own self. </p>

          <p>So what has kept others from having this same realization, and what silences us as a culture on the issue? Taylor sees three main factors. The first factor comes about because adopting the moral ideal of authenticity often comes along with a “liberalism of neutrality”. This is the idea that a liberal society must be neutral on questions of what constitutes a good life. While its citizens may have differing views on the subject, the government (and society as a whole) cannot take a side on the issue. Everyone must be able to decide what’s best for themselves.</p>

          <p>The second, and most prominent factor, is the hold of moral subjectivism in our culture. Moral subjectivism being the<p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">“view that moral positions are not in any way grounded in reason or the nature of things but are ultimately just adopted by each of us because we find ourselves drawn to them.”</blockquote> 
          <p>If this is true, then reason cannot judge moral disputes. If reason cannot judge moral disputes (so the reasoning goes) then there’s no point in talking about moral disputes, or changing our minds on our own viewpoints, or expecting that change from others. Ultimately, each of us does not hold to some part of a universal morality, but rather to unique feelings which differ from person to person on “moral” matters, and which we should allow to guide us. </p>

          <p>The last factor contributing to the silence on authenticity is “the normal fashion of social science explanation.” The social sciences tend to explain changes in human culture by citing non-moral human motivations. These motivations can be tied into moral ideals, but do not have to be (and usually are not). This avoidance of moral ideals within the scientific explanation is seen as “more scientific”, or often, more “objective”. </p>

          <p>Having made note of the things that we need to get past in order to have this conversation, Taylor states his three main assumptions that must be believed in order to continue on in his argument:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Authenticity is a valid ideal- this dismisses the major criticism of authenticity.</li>
            <li>You can argue in reason about ideals and the conformity of practices to these ideals- this involves rejecting subjectivism.</li>
            <li>These arguments can make a difference.- this is against the view that we are imprisoned by "the system" in modern culture.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Importance of Others</h2>

          <p>According to Taylor, human nature is, to its very core, dialogical. This is obvious for the typical person, but it’s present even for the solitary artist (he speaks to his future audience) or for the hermit (he speaks to God and to himself). Even when we are alone, we imagine conversations with people we’ve previously interacted with. Due to this, Taylor says,<p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">“the making and sustaining of our identity…remains dialogical throughout our lives.”</blockquote>

          <p>Taylor combines the above idea with his concept of Horizons of Significance. Meaning must be taken against a background, and so defining myself means defining what is significant (in terms of human importance) that differentiates me from others. These horizons of significance are backgrounds of intelligibility that give something importance. They’re meant to counteract the normal soft-relativism bent of authenticity as an ideal, and those who follow it. According to Taylor, “soft relativism self-destructs” because we can't just decide significance, an explanation is required to show significance. Without the explanation the claim to significance is unintelligible- we don't understand in what sense the significance is. Implicit in the idea is that the explanation that shows significance must be something that people could agree on. If nobody else can see why your explanation shows significance, then we’re back to subjectivism. </p>

          <p>It must be noted that one having chosen something is not by itself sufficient as a horizon of significance.<p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">"It may be important that life be chosen, but unless some options are more significant than others, the very idea of self choice falls into triviality and incoherence. Self choice as an ideal makes sense only because some issues are more significant than others.”</blockquote> 
          <p>Given this,<p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">“the ideal of self-choice supposes that there are other issues of significance beyond self choice.”</blockquote> 
          <p>Modes of authenticity that opt for self fulfillment without regard to demands of any kind emanating from something more or other than human desires or aspirations are self defeating. Straying from the self-defeating modes of authenticity, we find that<p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">“authenticity is not the enemy of demands that emanate from beyond the self; it supposes such demands.”</blockquote> 
          <p>We can also say that, tied in with the above,<p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">“modes of authenticity that opt for self fulfillment without regard to the demands of our ties with others are self defeating.”</blockquote>

          <p>Sticking to the better modes of authenticity then has a large impact on how we treat intimate relationships.<p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">"If the intense relations of self-exploration are going to be identity-forming, then they can't be in principle tentative…and they can't be merely instrumental...If my self-exploration takes the form of such serial and in principle temporary relationships, then it is not my identity that I am exploring, but some modality of enjoyment."</blockquote> 
          <p>So,</p> 
          <blockquote class="blockquote">“it would seem that having merely instrumental relationships is to act in a self-stultifying way.”</blockquote>

          <h2 class="section-heading">If We Can Identify the Better Modes of Authenticity, Then What Is The Problem?</h2>

          <p>Taylor, in huge contrast to other cultural thinkers of our day, doesn’t totally condemn the culture, but he doesn’t think it’s the best it can be either. He defines the culture of narcissism as the spread of an outlook that makes self-fulfillment the major value in life and that seems to recognize few external moral demands or serious commitment to others. Taylor says that this culture is reflecting a real ethical aspiration- the ideal of authenticity. However, they aren’t living up to that ideal. If he is right, then rather than a morally dead society (or one where being selfish is the right thing to do), there is instead a tension in society between the true ideal of authenticity and those who try to follow it. </p>

          <p>The other major threat to authenticity is identified as postmodernist thought. There are two particular dangers here: the slide towards the self-centered form of the ideal of self-fulfillment (via self-determining freedom) in the popular culture and the movement of "high" culture towards a negation of all horizons of significance (the major figure here is Nietzsche). Authenticity cannot and should not go all the way with self-determining freedom because self-determining freedom recognizes no limits on the individual and thus leads to a radical anthropocentrism. The negation of horizons of significance, as we saw earlier, nullifies authenticity. Without these horizons there is no authenticity. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">What Should Be Done?</h2>
          
          <p>According to Taylor, the struggle about authenticity will be continuous. Instead of looking for a trend in how things are going, we should recognize that</p> 
          <blockquote class="blockquote">"there is a struggle here, whose outcome is continually up for grabs.”</blockquote> 
          <p>He takes a strong stance against cultural pessimism. He thinks that they see developments in our culture as a set of new values of the rising generation, in which case everything is doomed. The right way to look at it is in the light of authenticity, in which case something can be done to make it better.</p>

          <p>But why should we hold authenticity as an ideal anyway? Taylor gives several reasons: Like other facets of modern individualism, it</p> 
          <blockquote class="blockquote">"points us toward a more self-responsible form of life...It allows us to live a (potentially) fuller and more differentiated life...at its best authenticity allows a richer mode of existence.”</blockquote> 
          <p>Additionally, while this is not an argument for the worth of the ideal, even the knockers of authenticity live according to it in some way:</p> 
          <blockquote class="blockquote">"it is hard to find anyone…in the mainstream of our western societies who, faced with their own life choices, about career or relationships, gives no weight at all to something they would identify as fulfillment, or self-development, or realizing their potential.” </blockquote>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Other Malaises</h2>

          <p>The last two chapters of “EofA” deal with the overuse of instrumental reason and the problem of soft despotism. These are much smaller treatments of the problems compared to Taylor’s discussion on individualism and they follow the same patterns- both boosters and knockers are wrong, the theme of retrieval where we seek to recover the actual ideal behind the problem and get past the obscurance that comes about from the arguments of both extreme sides, and the call to action to face the continual struggle over what’s happening in the culture. In the interest of space, I won’t be including any sort of summary of <i>Chapter 9: An Iron Cage?</i> other than to say that it’s the chapter that deals specifically with the overuse of instrumental reason, it's where Taylor (partly) explains why he’s against marxist/leninist ideology (they take instrumental reason too far), and that it’s well worth the read.</p>

          <p>In the interest of the same goal, I will provide only a very short summary of the final chapter: <i>Against Fragmentation</i>. Taylor has been active in politics for much of his life and in this chapter that experience shines through. I found it to be one of the most interesting chapters in the whole book due to his commentary on the political situation in the United States. His commentary, while true in 1992 when the book was published, is perhaps more relevant now. </p>

          <p>Taylor links the rise of soft despotism in the United States with the United States Judicial System’s relative abundance of power as compared to other countries. He doesn’t say this, but the system of checks and balances set forth in the United States constitution is clearly broken. Because of the Judicial System’s surplus of power, a lot of things that would be decided by the legislature in other countries are decided by the judiciary- and the public is okay with it. This has led to law schools becoming</p> 
          <blockquote class="blockquote">"the dynamic centres of social and political thought on American campuses.”</blockquote> 
          <p>Because the courts have become the decision makers on matters of public policy, the system causes large single issue campaigns, single issue political groups to gain the most support, and self-serving candidates to be the norm. </p>

          <p>Settling things judicially nullifies the possibility of compromise because judicial decisions are all or nothing. This lack of compromise causes greater fragmentation due to a rise in feelings that the system no longer represents as much as half of the citizenry, leading to greater social atomism, dropping out of political activity, and an all or nothing outlook on all political issues. Each of these factors in turn leads to greater fragmentation- it’s a vicious cycle. Without successful common action, there’s no way to reverse the cycle. </p>

          <p>Taylor’s solution is to decentralize power to units which</p> 
          <blockquote class="blockquote">“already figure as communities in the lives of their members.” </blockquote>

          <h2 class="section-heading">My Thoughts</h2>

          <p>Taylor had several goals (I presume) in mind with “EofA”. The most obvious was to make it an accessible work. At only 160 pages it's very short. Taylor doesn’t get too technical or delve into ideas without giving a good amount of background- both historical and philosophical. It’s fair to say that the average civically concerned reader could figure out what Taylor is getting at here- no need for any prior exposure to academic philosophy. The one place where Taylor failed in this was leaving untranslated latin and french statements interspersed throughout. It’s not always realistic to expect these to be decrypted using context clues.</p>

          <p>But this accessibility goal is also the bane of the book. Taylor chose to devote several chapters either mostly or wholly to historical background and explanations of his view of human nature, but chose not to give real arguments on anything he discusses. Taylor went too broad and the result is that the whole book feels like a vague framework for starting a discussion. It gives no real answers, only prompts more thought on the issues. Towards the end, when you realize there’s no answers to be had, it starts to feel empty. His argument for not giving answers is that many of the problems he chose to discuss require solutions specific to the particular issue that’s being addressed- but if this is the case he should have chosen one of those issues and given an extensive solution to show how his general ideas could be implemented in more individual contexts. Because he chose not to do this, one gets the sense that he’s using the accessibility goal of the book as a crutch to avoid having to defend some of his ideas- it’s hard to criticize someone’s ideas when they choose to provide plain propositions with no argument. I think the appropriate way to handle this would have been for Taylor either to have given himself more room and written a much larger, more focused book, or to have published a rigorous follow up.</p>

          <p>Having criticized the amount of space Taylor devotes to explaining his view on human nature (it being dialogical) and historical background, I only think it fair to point out that the historical background was both interesting and useful, and that his view of human nature and psychology is the main thing I remembered from the book, it having been years since I last read it. It’s not that his discussion on either was in any way bad, but rather that in such a short book, I felt he could have used the space better. Additionally, as I mentioned above, his insight into the socio-political status of the United States was stunningly accurate for our present time, despite having been written almost 30 years ago. Those insights will likely be the subject of a later article.</p>

          <p>Onto Taylor’s conception of the “higher” form of authenticity. Taylor gets a lot right- particularly in his method of analyzing individualism and instrumental reason from a less biased viewpoint than is traditionally done. This method gives a lot more answers and insight into the pros and cons of modernity and the ideals tied up in it as a result. It’s the sort of approach that I think most philosophers (should) try to take- coming at the problem from a unique angle, but few succeed in it. There are some parts of Taylor’s argument (such as it is) that I can’t abide by, however. </p>

          <p>The first major stumbling block in Taylor’s argument for authenticity has to do with his “Horizons of Significance.” They’re a wonderful attempt to require an objective basis outside of oneself for one’s identity and authenticity. Taylor’s discussion of choice alone not being sufficient for significance is especially poignant in our subjectivist culture. But, he doesn’t take it far enough. By placing the demands of one’s society on an equal level with those of history and nature and arguing that the “recognizable significance” of a horizon depends largely on it being recognized as such by those around you, Taylor effectively blocks his ideal of authenticity from subjectivism, but leads it wide open to cultural relativism. This ultimately leaves us with no answers- we can see that we want an objective basis for our standards, but are left wanting in that objective standards aren’t the only ones available to be used to define our authenticity. </p>

          <p>My second issue is with Taylor’s notion of authenticity having “high” and “low” forms. I agree with him on this, partially because he identifies the “low” forms with postmodernist philosophy, but he doesn’t give a good basis for the distinction. Taylor’s argument for why his higher view should be taken amounts to “because it seems to be true.” That is not an argument, but an observation. Over the course of the book, Taylor never gives a moral argument for why we should seek to be less self-centered, less anthropocentric, and more objective. He simply points at those things and pairs them with their bad results: the decrease in lifelong intimate relationships, environmental destruction, and logical inconsistency in our ways of life. While I, and most readers, will readily agree that these are all bad things, that does not amount to a moral argument for why the low forms are inherently wrong. It’s only an argument from bad results. He doesn’t argue for a basis on why those bad results are morally wrong either- which needs to be a part of his argument when the “low” forms of the culture he is addressing don’t necessarily think that things like the decrease in lifelong intimate relationships are a morally bad outcome to begin with. </p>

          <p>Another issue I have is with La Lotta Continua. The chapter is effectively a call to arms- to see the continuous struggle over our culture and its future not as something to cause despair, but as a continually shifting battleground, where a loss today doesn’t mean a growing trend of losses that will continue into tomorrow. One where the flow can always change. One where the battle can always be won, but never the war- for both sides. This can be seen as a very positive state of affairs for certain downward trending political factions who may feel they’ve lost. This message says nothing for their groups themselves, but does say that the culture itself is never beyond reach. That’s all well and good. What this chapter lacks is concrete examples on how to move forward with the issues that Taylor has described. Without at least an example, we are left with just the whiff of a framework, an ideological call to arms with no real answers.</p>

          <p>Taylor’s discussion of compromise holds another problem. The ideas are good. Taylor states that many of our culture’s struggles around hot topic issues has to do with how we frame these issues. We start from a point of black and white, with no in between. This necessarily leaves no room for compromise- no morally upright person would willingly allow for the side of position that is wholly wrong. The problem comes about when Taylor gets to his prime example of this phenomenon. His pick is abortion. I think the one point of agreement across all viewpoints on the abortion debate is actually that it is black or white- where that point is may vary, but either you think that what’s being killed is a human child with full personhood, or you don’t. Either you think that forcing a woman to bear a child is hugely immoral, or you don’t. I’m not saying that there aren’t nuanced issues at stake here, but rather that an issue so deeply caught up with our views of autonomy, personhood, human nature, morality, and choice might not have been the best example on how we don’t frame issues well.</p>

          <p>My last point has to do with Taylor’s third assumption in his framework: “Authenticity is a valid moral ideal.” There’s too much there to unpack in a single article, so I will focus on a more narrow opposing claim: authenticity is, at best, a second rate moral ideal. Taylor defines a moral ideal pretty typically as,</p> 
          <blockquote class="blockquote">“a picture of what a better or higher mode of life would be, it offers a standard of what we ought to desire.”</blockquote> 
          <p>That’s a very high rung to occupy in a person’s psyche. It means that authenticity isn’t just something that’s good if you can reach that point, or something that you have an option to choose to pursue. Authenticity, as a moral ideal, is an obligation akin to “do not murder” or “do not steal”. The first problem here is that moral ideals only make sense within a greater moral system. Taylor doesn’t propose or explicitly assume any such system (see my above issue on “high” and “low” forms), and thus we are left to assume that he meant within the most popular western modern moral system- it certainly would not attain the high status of a moral ideal within Christianity, or any of the Abrahamaic religions for that matter. That leaves out a good portion of the western world.</p>

          <p>However, let us say that Taylor’s target is some form of humanism (which it most likely is). Taking the Oxford Languages definition, that means an idea system that, “stress[es] the potential value and goodness of human beings, emphasize[s] common human needs, and seek[s] solely rational ways of solving human problems.” In this case I think we can see that authenticity could comfortably attain to the realm of moral ideals.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

          <p><i>The Ethics of Authenticity</i> is a broad framework with no real answers. If the goal was a logically sound argument that seeks to convince everyone to live their lives in a more objective manner- then this book is a failure. However, if the goal was an accessible jumping off point for calling for an end to cultural pessimism and a motivation for cultural-political change, then this book is a grand effort. Either way, Taylor’s ideas are worth the ride. While this would never go on a list of best philosophy books for me, perhaps it deserves a place on my list of most personally influential.</p>
