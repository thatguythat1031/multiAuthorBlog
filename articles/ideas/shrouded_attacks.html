          <p>The nature of the political scene has become increasingly more hostile as both the media and the populace are gradually polarized. Political actors seeking to rally their base levy heavy charges against their opponents, giving little depth to their statement and following a pattern of communication you would expect out of despondent adolescents, not people leading and shaping governmental policy. Whether or not the semi-cryptic nature of their messages is always intended, the impact on the audience is large with different levels of reaction. I am not seeking to be swallowed in the mire of modern politics, so I will not provide direct examples from the current political scene, but instead I seek to discuss the two types of actors that perpetrate this behavior, the effects on the audience, the inevitability of the actions, and what the populace can do to correct or limit the effect.</p>

          <p>These attacks, which I will call shrouded-attacks here on forward, are not just name calling -  usually they involve identifying a characteristic of someone's person or their ideas and stating that characteristic as implicitly undesirable without stating what about it makes it so. The perpetrator presumes a common lexicon between them and their supporters and utilizes that as a quick method of communication instead of forming descriptive statements and arguments against their opponent. For a theoretical example, we can use Person A accusing Person B of being a ‘Commie’ in a speech to their supporters, and Person B questioning Person A’s legitimacy due to their religious views. The matter of the example is irrelevant, madlib it for all I care, it is the form that is of concern and it is the form that is causing damage.</p>

          <p>We can break up these attacks between the intentional and the unintentional. Intentionality does not mean that those who unintentionally committed a shrouded-attack said the words without their own consent or out of a slip of the tongue, but they did not intend the full effect of their words. These people are following the forms that are common before them and are just seeking to throw a charge out that will stick. They may even lack the awareness of the issues they create. This is probably the majority of political actors and we can with some accuracy assume that those making shrouded-attacks belong to this category. The people, who in full knowledge of the effects levy these attacks belong in a different category. These actions become calculated maneuvers that quickly stir up passions and rally their base while hitting the opponent and weakening their support. Outside of an explicit confession from the person, we will never be able to tell if they are aware of what they are doing. Our best chance at identifying perpetrators of intentional shrouded-attacks is by looking at their history and relying on circumstantial evidence. This leaves much to be desired, but it is not my intention to necessarily be able to identify these people - witch hunts are not my goal.</p>

          <p>These attacks largely rely on a common lexicon. Words always have their dictionary definition, but they also have their fluid definition which is established by the internal dynamics of the group. This internal definition changes with the present socio-political reality and history, influencing whether or not a term is deemed offensive and changing the definition. It is through this collective group-assigned definition that the actors can transmit large amounts of data and ideas implicitly through few words. Person B may very well identify as a Communist, but Person A’s comment calling them a ‘Commie’ holds more data then merely identifying the economic philosophy of their opponent; implicit in their vitriolic statement is at the very least that Communists are bad and that they should not be operating in whatever function Person A and Person B are involved in. Antithetical to the previous comment, the followers of Person A may cheer and rally around the Communist ideals and be happy to take on the title of ‘Communist’ or even ‘Commie’, the latter if out of spite of the opposition. The diverging definitions of the lexicon show and explain the differing effects the same words can have on two different groups, and therin lies part of the danger. What results is a communication breakdown, where the same words reach all parties, but where each party walks away with something different. True, everyone has their own subjective experience and even within a group a word may have slightly different effects and nuances, but the power of the difference is greater when the difference is shared by more than one.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately the way we communicate and the acceptable amount of time to relay a message oftentimes forces us to rely on these internal definitions; it would be too laborious for the communicator and too taxing on the communicant to go through deep and detailed discussions where things are explicitly defined. The result is possible miscommunication internally, and dialogue that appears to be speaking past the opponent in inter-group conversation. This breakdown of communication has been around forever, and likely will continue to be around. That does not however mean that we are condemned to ineffective communication in total and that we can't seek a higher ideal.</p>

          <p>Much of the issue can be resolved through education. In the face of an intentional attack, the educated populace will be able to identify what exactly the perpetrator is saying, what is implicitly communicated, and what is objectively true. While we can never remove the passions from conversation, being knowledgeable in the things that exist behind the statement allows for a better disconnect between our emotions and our intellect, and leaves us less prey to impassioned and vitriolic speech. This does not necessarily entail that a person loses their philosophical beliefs, or they must become watered down; all that is necessary is that we have an understanding of the multitude of sides in an issue. This educated stance paired with patience and a will to understand will help alleviate the discord. By actively seeking to understand the other side we become less likely to entertain vitriolic sentiments and we are more likely to productively converse, not just repeat our soundbytes past the person.</p>
          
          <p>The likelihood that people will take up the helm and educate themselves is unfortunately very low. It isn’t a matter of a lack of intelligence, it is a matter of values and how we respond to moral rulings; it takes work to do these things and often people would rather spend their time in a myriad of other ways than to read a stuffy old book and listen to the other side. That people would take up a nature of understanding is equally if not more unlikely. People have a tendency towards conflict unless guided by some external reasoning and even tend to relish in it. This does not mean that all is lost and that there is no hope. The change for society begins one at a time, and for every person who adopts an attitude of learning and understanding, the chances of someone else being influenced increases. Without these two facets becoming integral in our lives, society is damned to continue to balkanize and we will lose the ability to come together as a people. It is becoming more imperative to seek this work and to establish a new counter culture - one which does not aim to angstily rebell, but seeks to know and understand.</p>
