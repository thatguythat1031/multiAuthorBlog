          <p>The framing effect is an oft learned subject in both psychology and statistics. It “refers to how decision-makers view a problem from a win-loss perspective,” in the words of a class I’m currently taking. It’s also said that “the way a problem is framed often influences choices in irrational ways.” </p>
          <p>I’ve taken 3 different statistics based courses (one a high school AP course, the other two were college courses) and the framing effect has been introduced in the same way all three times. </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">“Suppose you may be given up to $1000 and must choose between:
                <ul>
                    <li>$500 right now</li>
                    <li>Flip a coin and receive $1000 if it’s heads or $0 if it’s tails”</li>
                </ul>
            </blockquote>
          <p>The claim is then made that if one chooses the “$500 right now” option due to thinking it is more likely to result in a “win” then that is acting irrationally and is only done if one is risk averse - this is the framing effect (according to the given example). </p>
          <p>The claim is based wholly on the idea that the expected value of option 1 and option 2 are both the same: $500. This is because expected value is equal to the chance of each option times the value of each option. So in this case, $500 * 100% is equal to $500 AND ($1000 * 50%) + ($0 * 50%) is equal to $500. So, since the expected value of each option is the same, each option must be an equally rational one if one is trying to maximize their reward, right?</p>
          <p>That is what the example and the classes I’ve attended claim. The problem is, it’s incorrect. </p>
          <p>Expected value as given in this equation only holds true in the long run - due to the probabilities being present. It is true that, in the long run you would be irrational to pick option one if you thought that was safer. However, this example is always presented as a one time deal, in which case, you would be acting more rationally to pick the $500 right now if pursuing a maxamin strategy (which most people unconsciously do), as that gives you a good payoff no matter what, whereas the coin flip may leave you with nothing. </p>
          <p>Again, the above example is valid if the “in the long run,” clause is added to it. However, the problem is that every time I’ve seen it presented, that clause is either excluded entirely, or put in as some sort of fine print. Why?</p>
