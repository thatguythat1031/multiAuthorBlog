          <p>With all the trouble and lawsuits these past few years it is not surprising to hear that the National council of Boy Scouts of America has filed for bankruptcy. The immoral actions by bad leaders justly combatted in court alongside the actions of greedy lawyers looking to get their buck have taken a toll on the funds of the organization. To my understanding, this only affects National, and not the Local councils; all their assets and property is under a separate legal entity and is not going to be affected. But, my goal here isn’t to talk about the politics of the BSA, but of a particular note about the program I find commendable.</p>

          <p>I spent most of my childhood in the Scouting program; starting when I was about 6 and going through till I aged out at 18. As you go you are taught the usual things you would expect; camping, outdoor skills, leadership, how to light just about anything on fire, and the rest. Once I was firmly established in Scouting, I realized what things I liked and focused on those, preferring the naturalist skills and the leadership (merit badges were the most boring thing under the sun, so they can go pound sand). My troop had a bit of an issue in retaining the older scouts who were traditionally the leaders, so I got into leadership early and maintained some form of it from 11 y/o onwards.</p>

          <p>One of my biggest gripes were the inefficiencies of the meeting. I always found that the opening and closing ceremony, in my troop led by a different patrol each week, to be cringe inducing and never done with any eye towards time. The patrol picked for the week would invariably not plan what they were going to do, so they would get up there and have to decide amongst themselves what they were going to showcase, and then what usually followed was a poor rendition of some camp song. Lame, cringy, inefficient, and a waste of my time. Once I took on the helm as Senior Patrol Leader, I nixed the issue; opening was the Pledge of Allegiance followed by recitations of the Scout Oath and Law, and the closing was Vespers. Maybe it was not super creative, but it allowed for a timely start and departure each meeting which the parents and I appreciated.</p>

          <p>The choices seemed rather obvious, but I think the actuality of what we were doing was lost to me, at least at the time. I’m not going to talk about the Oath and Law but the thing I want to focus on is Vespers. It is a simple song, no more than a few lines, meant to be sung or recited at the end of a gathering or at night at closing ceremonies of a campout. Much like any sort of creed or rote recitation of some prewritten material, it was largely said with null intention with barely a care given to its meaning. True, I don’t know what everyone was thinking as they recited it, but I do know that I recited it out of pattern and once I got through the words I was on to the next task. </p>

          <p>That does not do the song any justice. It is a prosaic reminder that strikes at the heart of not just the Scouting movement, but of most religions and philosophies that have enough salt to consider following. It calls you to reflect on your day, to think about if you truly spent your time wisely and productively. The scouting movement is not about wearing lame uniforms and whittling sticks, it is about developing boys into young men and training them to have the capabilities and the mind of a respectable man. Doing such is nigh impossible if you do not put a level of reflection into your routine. You may be able to recite the creed and the law, have a full sash of merit badges, and have the Scout handbook memorized but if you do not reflect on yourself, you have become either a mindless drone or just a vacant repository of knowledge. </p>

          <p> The world is full of too many complexities and diverse situations to be able to give a handbook for them all. Lord Baden Powel saw that and that is why Scouting is designed to teach skills, not responses, and skills need thought and conversation to develop. So as the sun runs its course and we draw the curtains on the day, we are obligated to ask ourselves how did we spend the day? Did we live up to our obligations to others and ourselves? And if not, how do we start the next day, more prepared than the last.</p>

          <p><i><center>While our campfire fades away.</center></i></p>

          <p><i><center>Silently each Scout should ask</center></i></p>

          <p><i><center>Have I done my daily task?</center></i></p>

          <p><i><center>Have I kept my honor bright?</center></i></p>

          <p><i><center>Can I guiltless sleep tonight?</center></i></p>

          <p><i><center>Have I done and have I dared</center></i></p>

          <p><i><center>Everything to be prepared?"</center></i></p>
